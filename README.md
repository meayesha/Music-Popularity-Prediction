# Music-Popularity-Prediction

In this Music Data Analysis we propose a system where we predict popularity of the music. We consider musical complexity as a cue that can be extracted from the audio signal and can be used for the popularity prediction. We examine the effectiveness of the early-stage popularity for long-term popularity prediction. We apply different supervised algorithms for the prediction and comparison of these algorithm with their respected accuracy, RMSE score. Various features of the music are taken into consideration and we perform the Exploratory Data Analysis on each of the features.
Keywordsâ€“ Prediction, Exploratory Data Analysis, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression.
